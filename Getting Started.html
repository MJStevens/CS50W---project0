            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              While the idea of growing bonsai from seed appeals to many beginners it is not very common due to the amount of time and effort required.
              Growing a bonsai from seed is a long term project that requires near daily attention for at least 10 years and quite a bit of horticultural knowledge.
              If you do everything correctly you may have a small bonsai in 10 years. The best bonsai are grown for 20-25 years before they ever see a bonsai pot.
              In addition to patience you will need quite a bit of space to maintain hundreds of seedlings due to the high mortality rate of trees and unpredictability of their genetic characteristics and growth patterns.
              You will also need a reliable watering system as one or two missed days can set a tree back years or even kill it.
              For beginners interested in bonsai it is recommended  that they buy a bonsai tree from a reputable seller rather than attempting to grow their own as it will take two to three years before they have the opportunity to practice any bonsai techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that bit out of the way, growing bonsai from seed can be a very rewarding process - weather or not you end up with a masterpiece.
              For many people Japanese black pines are the king of bonsai species. Even for people not familiar with the art, a Japanese black pine is often what they picture when they think of bonsai.
              With their elegant grey-green needles, dark, course and heavily fissured bark, Japanese black pines form the perfect image of an aged tree on a miniature scale.
              They are popular to the extent that entire books have been dedicated to their development. For this reason all the information found here is intended only as a primer to equip the reader with the basics needed to research the matter further.
              While the process is conceptually simple - place seeds in soil, water them and wait - a variety of techniques can be applied to improve the results.
            </p>
            <h2>Climate/Location</h2>
            <p>
              Ideally Japanese black pines should be grown in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8 however they can tolerate warmer environments. Here are a few USDA maps by location.

            <p>
              The trees require full sun to thrive and will not survive long indoors.
              Ideally they should be placed in a spot where they receive around 6 hours of direct sun per day and have good air circulation.
              Too much or too little sun will result in pale leaves and weak growth.
              If grown on a balcony place them as close to the railing as possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Timing</h2>
            <p>
              As with most plants, the best time to sow their seeds is at the beginning of spring.
              To ensure optimal germination rates a period of dormancy is required.
              This is discussed a little later on but make sure you have your seeds 2-3 weeks before you intend to plant them.
            </p>
            <h2>Collecting seeds</h2>
            <p>
              If you intend to collect the seeds your self, bare in mind that not all trees are created equally.
              Be sure to select seeds from parent trees with desirable characteristics such as straight, dark needles, short inter-nodes, compact growth and bark with a good texture.
              In autumn collect a number of green or purple cones that have yet to open.
              Once you get them home give them a quick dip in a dilute lime sulfur solution to kill any fungus and place them somewhere away from pests to dry out and mature.
              In a few weeks they should turn brown and open, just tap the cones on their end and the seeds should fall out.
            </p>
            <h2>Preparation of seeds</h2>
            <p>
              To sort the bad seeds from the good, soak them in water that has been boiled and allowed to cool for a day. The seeds which float are likely sterile and can be discarded.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stratifying the seeds before planting greatly increases their germination rate.
              To do this place the seeds in a plastic bag with paper towels, soil or sphagnum moss to keep them moist.
              Place the bag in your refrigerator for 1 to 2 weeks.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Getting%20Started%20-%20Strat.jpg" alt="Soak seeds for 24 hours">
            <h2>Planting seeds</h2>
            <p>
              Large flat trays or pots tend to be best for planting large groups of seeds.
              Trays with individual sections for each seed are more difficult to manage as you need to ensure that each section has an adequate amount of water.
              A coarse, free draining substrate is best.
              A thick layer of mid-sized pumice particles covered with a mix of crushed silica rock and milled pine bark topped with silica sand works well but the exact mix is not critical.
              Almost anything will work as long as it is free draining enough to dry in a day or two.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure an even spread of seeds in the container, poke holes around 3-5cm apart with a chopstick and place the seeds into them with a pair of tweezers.
              Once the seeds are planted use a ruler to close the holes.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Getting%20Started%20-%20Seed%201.jpg" alt="Plant seeds in pot.">
            <p>
              Keep the container moist and in a location out of direct midday sun but where there is plenty of of indirect light.
              If the container is outdoors be sure to place a screen over it to keep the seeds safe from hungry birds.
              It should take between one and four weeks for all of the seeds to sprout. No more work is required until the seedlings are about two months old.
              No fertilizer is necessary at this stage however if you wish you can add a balanced liquid fertilizer at quarter strength with each watering.
            </p>
