            <h2>Why make seedling cuttings</h2>
            <p>
              Japanese black pines are coastal trees and grow a tap root to help prevent them being uprooted during high winds.
              Unfortunately a dominant tap root is an issue if you wish to grow the tree in a small pot.
              To deal with this issue bonsai enthusiasts often cut the tap root of young trees as this forces the seedling to produce a number of lateral roots.
              These roots emerge at the same level which helps to create a good root flare.
              In addition to this it often will cause the seedling to bud very low down the trunk and these branches can be used to help develop and thicker trunk with a better taper.
              The downside is that the process significantly retards the growth of the seedling but in the long term it produces much better results.
            </p>
            <h2>How to make seedling cuttings</h2>
            <p>
              Start by preparing containers for the new cuttings.
              To help speed up the growth of roots the seedlings will be dipped in rooting hormone once the tap root has been cut off.
              To help improve the efficiency of this it is necessary to prepare the pots an soil in such a way that there will be minimal disturbance to the rooting hormone when the seedlings are planted and watered.
              Prepare 7.5 to 10cm pots filled with a soil mix similar to that described in the getting started section.
              Make sure the soil mix is well watered before planting your cuttings.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Soil%201.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Remove a small section of the soil mix from the center and fill the hole with fine silica sand and then make a small hole in the center.
            </p>

            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Soil%203.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Now it is time to prepare your rooting hormone.
              Make sure you have enough ready as it is best to do the steps that follow as quickly as possible to prevent the seedlings from drying out.
              Once you are ready bare root all of the seedlings you wish to make cuttings of taking care not to damage their leaves.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Soil%204.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Use a sharp, sterile knife to cut the stem just below the point that it changes color.
              If you have a large number of seedlings it is best to drop them in a bowl of water to keep them from drying out.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Planting%201.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Now dip the ends of the cuttings into your rooting hormone making sure a liberal amount is applied.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Planting%202.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Place the cuttings in the holes you created and gently push the soil together taking care not to disturb the rooting hormone.
            </p>
            <img src="./Images/Seedling%20Cuttings%20-%20Planting%203.jpg" alt="Prepare the soil.">
            <p>
              Keep the cuttings in a shaded area for at least a month before slowly moving them to a spot where they will receive full sunlight.
              Don't allow the soil to completely dry out and when you notice that the cuttings have started growing (evidence that new roots have grown) you can start to fertilize.
