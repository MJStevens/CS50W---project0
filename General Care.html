            <h2>Watering</h2>
            <p>
              Watering your seedlings on a schedule is usually not suitable, it is best to only water once the top centimeter or two of soil has completely dried out.
              If the seedlings are watered excessively they will suffer from root rot and die.
              Once you get a feel for it you should be able to judge how wet the soil is from the weight of the pots but until then sticking a chopstick or toothpick into the soil to gauge moisture levels works well.
              It is best to water the seedlings in the morning when possible to help reduce the amount of time the roots sit in waterlogged soil.
              The young seedlings roots can be somewhat sensitive to mineral content of the water so it is best not to use hardwater.
              Every few months it is beneficial to water the seedlings thoroughly, allowing the water to drain through the soil and wash out all accumulated salts from fertilizers which can burn the roots if allowed to build up to a high concentration.
            </p>
            <h2>Fertilization</h2>
            <p>
              During the growing season feed the seedlings weekly with a balanced liquid fertilizer but gradually reduce to a half strength solution during winter.
              For optimal growth use add a few high nitrogen fertilizer pellets to ensure the plant is fertilized with every watering.
            </p>
            <h2>Disease</h2>
            <p>
              While Japanese black pines are quite resistant to most pests they can suffer from fungal issues especially in warmer climates.
              Monthly treatments with an anti fungal spray are recommended.
              Sprays using Mancozeb as their main anti fungal agent are usually recommended.
              Curled and disfigured needles are a sure sign of a fungal issue.
            </p>

            <h2>Everything else</h2>
            <p>
              Once the seedlings start growing strong you can start gradually moving them into the sun.
              They prefer full sun but don't like their roots getting too hot.
              In very warm climates it may be necessary to bury their pots in the ground to prevent the roots burning during the hot season.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't wire or prune the plants in their first year.
              Typically the initial wiring required to give the trunk its shape will be done during the third spring.
              For now we want the seedlings to grow as strongly as possible and damaging them via wiring or pruning will only slow the growth down.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may help to setup a schedule to keep track of weather various tasks were performed. 
              A spreadsheet or table similar to the following can help ensure that you don't forget to do anything and serve as a historical reference which you can use to diagnose problems.
